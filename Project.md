# Concept of A Stack Overflow and its Exploitation Process Using A Simple analogy:

## 1. Step-by-Step Walkthrough:
### a. Building a Stack:

Picture a stack like a pile of plates in a cafeteria. Each plate represents a task or function that the computer is handling.
### b. Function Calls:

When a function is called, a plate is added to the stack. The computer keeps track of where it should go back to after finishing each task.
### c. Limited Space:

Just like there's limited space on the plate rack, the computer's stack has a limited capacity. It can only handle a certain number of function calls at once.
### d. Overflowing the Stack:

Now, imagine someone keeps adding plates without considering the limited space. Eventually, the plates start falling off the rack – this is the "stack overflow."
### e. Changing the Order:

When the plates fall, they disrupt the order. Similarly, in a computer, overflowing the stack can disrupt the program's normal flow.
### f. Redirecting Execution:

The fallen plates can be strategically placed to change the order of tasks. In a computer, this is like changing the normal flow of the program.
### g. Executing Malicious Code:

If the fallen plates (altered program flow) contain specific instructions, it's like the computer following a different set of tasks – potentially running malicious code.
## 2. Exploitation Techniques:
### a. Injecting Malicious Code:

An attacker might overflow the stack with more data than it can handle. If this data includes carefully crafted instructions (malicious code), the program might execute those instructions.
### b. Altering Function Pointers:

Function pointers are like arrows pointing to tasks. By manipulating these pointers during a stack overflow, an attacker can make the computer jump to unexpected tasks.
### c. Manipulating the Stack:

Changing the order of tasks on the stack can lead to unexpected outcomes. An attacker can manipulate this to control the program's behavior.
## 3. Examples of Exploitation:
### a. Buffer Overflow in a Password Field:

Imagine a login system where an attacker inputs a ridiculously long password. If the program doesn't check the input length, it might overflow the stack, allowing the attacker to alter the program's behavior and gain unauthorized access.
### b. Web Server Vulnerability:

In web servers, input from users is a potential entry point. If an attacker sends data that overflows the stack, they might be able to inject code that manipulates the server's behavior, potentially leading to data breaches or service disruptions.
### c. SQL Injection Attack:

In database systems, a poorly sanitized input can lead to a stack overflow. An attacker can then inject SQL commands, altering the intended database queries and gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Preventing stack overflow vulnerabilities involves robust input validation, using secure coding practices, and implementing protective mechanisms within software.
